## 📌 Overview

The **Plagiarism Detection System** is a web-based application that analyzes submitted text or uploaded documents and compares them against a local corpus of reference documents.

It uses a **hybrid unsupervised machine learning approach** — combining **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity** and **MinHash Jaccard Similarity** — to produce a reliable ensemble plagiarism score with sentence-level match highlighting.

---

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|:--|:--|
| 📄 **Document Analysis** | Paste full text for document-level plagiarism scanning |
| 🔍 **Sentence Check** | Instantly check a single sentence against the entire corpus |
| 📁 **File Upload** | Upload `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` files for analysis |
| 🗂️ **Corpus Management** | Add, upload, or remove reference documents via the UI |
| 🧠 **Ensemble Scoring** | Combined TF-IDF + MinHash score for higher accuracy |
| 🚦 **Risk Classification** | Automatic risk level: `Low` / `Moderate` / `High` / `Critical` |
| 📊 **Session History** | Track all checks performed during the current session |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The detection engine applies two complementary similarity algorithms and combines them into a single ensemble score:

```
Ensemble Score = (0.6 × Cosine Similarity) + (0.4 × Jaccard Similarity)
```

| Algorithm | Weight | Description |
|:--|:--:|:--|
| **TF-IDF Cosine Similarity** | 60% | Measures vocabulary and term-frequency overlap |
| **MinHash Jaccard Similarity** | 40% | Approximates set-based shingle overlap via LSH |

### 🚦 Risk Level Thresholds

| Ensemble Score | Risk Level | Interpretation |
|:--:|:--:|:--|
| `< 0.26` | 🟢 **Low** | Content appears mostly original |
| `0.26 – 0.50` | 🟡 **Moderate** | Some sections may require review |
| `0.51 – 0.75` | 🟠 **High** | Significant similarity detected |
| `≥ 0.76` | 🔴 **Critical** | Content is likely plagiarized |

## 🖥️ Usage Guide

### 📄 Check Document Tab
- **Upload File** — Select a `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` file and click **Upload & Analyze**
- **Paste Text** — Paste any block of text and click **Analyze**
- **Quick Sentence Check** — Paste a single sentence and click **Check Sentence**

### 📊 Results Tab
- View the ensemble score and risk level
- Inspect per-document match scores with cosine and Jaccard breakdown
- Review flagged sentence pairs with similarity percentages and source attribution

### 🗂️ Corpus Tab
- **Upload File** — Add a `.txt`, `.pdf`, or `.docx` directly as a reference document
- **Paste Text** — Manually add a document with a custom title
- View word counts and dates for all corpus documents
- Remove any document from the corpus at any time

### 🕘 History Tab

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## 📦 Dependencies

| Package | Purpose |
|:--|:--|
| `Flask` | Web framework and routing |
| `scikit-learn` | TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity |
| `datasketch` | MinHash signatures and LSH indexing |
| `nltk` | Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization |
| `PyPDF2` | PDF text extraction |
| `python-docx` | DOCX text extraction |

> **Note:** NLTK resources (`punkt`, `stopwords`, `wordnet`) are downloaded automatically on first run.

---

## 📝 Notes

- Submission history is stored **in memory only** and resets when the server restarts
- The corpus loads `.txt` files from the `corpus/` directory at startup
- Uploaded PDF and DOCX files are extracted to plain text before being saved to the corpus
- For production use, consider replacing in-memory history with a database such as **SQLite** or **PostgreSQL**

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Persistent history storage with a database
- [ ] User authentication and per-user corpus management
- [ ] Support for additional file formats (`.odt`, `.rtf`)
- [ ] Internet-scale detection via external academic APIs
- [ ] Exportable plagiarism reports in PDF format
